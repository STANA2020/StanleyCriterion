# Sample Outputs

This directory contains example results generated by simulation scripts in the `simulations/` folder.
Each `.npy` file contains raw numerical values of the alignment functional \( \mathcal{A}(t) \) over time,
and each `.png` file is a visual plot of that data.

## Files Included

- `vortex_A_t.npy` — Alignment functional during decay of a single rotating vortex.
- `jet_nozzle_A_t.npy` — Alignment behavior under pressure-driven pulsed jet flow.
- `channel_obstruction_A_t.npy` — Functional response in a channel with internal geometry.
- `isotropic_turbulence_A_t.npy` — Stochastic decay of \( \mathcal{A}(t) \) in isotropic turbulence.
- `vortex_collision_A_t.npy` — Oscillatory behavior of alignment during ring collision.

## Visual Plots

- `vortex_A_t.png` — Smooth exponential decay.
- `jet_nozzle_A_t.png` — Stable alignment with initial transients.
- `three_simulations_A_t.png` — Combined visualization of collision, turbulence, and channel tests.

Each simulation script generates these files automatically when run.
